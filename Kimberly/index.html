            <h2>Information about Coronavirus and Quarantine</h2>
            <p> <b> What is Coronavirus and how has it affected many people?</b> </p>
            <p>Coronavirus (Covid-19) is a disease that started early in the year. Symptoms of this disease include: fever, 
              coughs, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle and body aches, etc. Other warnings in a person are confusion, 
              trouble breathing, pain and pressure in the chest, inability to stay alert, and changes in the color of the face.
              Due to the rapid spread of the disease over one million people worldwide have died. Those who have severe medical 
              conditions like heart or lung diseases and diabetes are likely to contract the disease and have serious complications.
              Those who did not and have not developed Covid-19 in their body have quarantined to avoid getting infected to protect
              those around them and themselves.</p>
            
            <p> <b>How has quarantine changed the way people live?</b></p>
            <p>Quarantine was imposed when the numbers of cases rised dramatically. Since the comencement of the outbreak the 
              way we live has changed. Schools were closed, forcing students to learn remotely and many adults were left 
              unemployed. Staying at home has caused people to deal with their new lifestyle from home preventing them from
              associating with others in person. This has affected many emotionally and physically because they do not accept
              having to be confined within four walls. Due to this many have resorted to eating to forget about the current 
              situation. Quarantine has brought a level of stress upon everyone whether people are not employed and have bills
              to pay, or students are learning remotely with a huge amount of work. </p>

                 can get very overwhelming. Many can start to become depressed or stressed as their situation 
                 gets worst by the day. Taking just five minutes of your day to meditate, breath
                 and close your eyes can help your mind clear itself and stop thinking of all the negative happening around. 
                 Simply not thinking, can relieve your mind from any stressful thoughts and feel better by getting your 
                 mind to relax.</p>

          <h2>Games</h2> 
          <p>What are some fun entertaining games?</p>
          <p>Due to being in quarantine many of us are resorting to using our phones in order to find entertainment. 
            Watching tv, going on social media, and simply sleeping is taking all of our time because instead of 
            accomplishing something productive we are limiting ourselves to spending so much time looking at a screen.
            One way that this affects us is that by being entertained in theses devices we are losing connection with 
            the people around us. Through this there is no communication or interest to interact socially with others 
            that might be doing the same mistake. Another effect it has on our lives is that we are not putting our 
            minds to work and think rather than just process what we watch. There are many games that help maintains us
            entertained, occupied, and most of all it forces our brain to function and find ways to win the game!</p>
            
            <p>The following are some games that you may find entertaining:</p>

            <div class="Games">
              <h4><p align="Left"> Jenga </p></h4> 
              <img src="https://jenga-game.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hasbro-jenga-mini-game-300x300.jpg">
              <p align="justify">Jenga is a game that requires mental skills and physical strategies. The game consists of stacking 
                 blocks in which anyone can play and each person takes a turn to remove a block from the tower and place
                 it on the top. By doing this, the tower will become taller and can start to become unstable causing the 
                 structure to collapse. The rules are that one person is to build the tower by placing three bocks next 
                 to each other, follow by other three blocks perpendicular to the bottom ones and continuing the process.
                 The players can only use one hand to take one block and place on the top level. The game ends when the 
                 tower falls over or if a block falls.
                </p>

              <h4><p align="Left"> UNO</p></h4>
              <img src="https://fanatical.imgix.net/product/original/b2e25f5e-a2cf-4d10-8698-d445ecf6640e.jpeg?auto=compress,format&w=400&fit=max">
                
              <p align="justify">UNO is one of the classic games that can be enjoed with the whole family. This game is played by 
                 players taking turns to match the card before with a card with the same color or number. If one player
                 does not have a card that matches the previous then they have to grab from the center pile until they 
                 find a card. In this game there are special cards that make the game more fun and interesting to play 
                 such as the Skips, Reverses, Draw Twos, Draw Fours, and the Wild cards. When one player comes down to 
                 their last card they need to shout "UNO!" When the person manages to get rid of all the cards they are 
                 declared the winner.</p>

              <h4><p align="Left">Scrabble</p></h4>

              <p align="justify">Scrabble is a game that can be played by two people. The players create words with the tiles given on 
                 the board and each have point values that can rise the value of the tile or the word. The skills needed 
                 are to have advance vocabulary, great spelling, and importantly a strategy. All the words formed need to 
                 be defined in the dictionary. One letter that has a lot of worth is the letter "Z" and there are many four
                 lettered words that contain the letter "Z" that are considered legal in the Scrabble dictionary. Some words
                 that can be memorized are AZAN, BOZO, CHEZ, FAZE, HAZE, HAZY FUZZ, JAZZ, LAZY, MAZE, OOZE, QUIZ, ZETA, ZONE, 
                 ZOOM, SIZE, and COZY.</p>

              <h4><p align="Left">Pictionary</p></h4>
              <img src="https://partycity6.scene7.com/is/image/PartyCity/_pdp_sq_?$_300x300_$&$product=PartyCity/784117_02">
              <p align="justify">Pictionary is a fun game that can be played with family members or with friends. This game is a drawing
                 game in which one person let's say from a team of two draws the image that they got based on the card 
                 they picked. Then the other person from the team has one minute to guess what the drawing is with a phrase
                 or word. The game provides 4 category cards, 496 cards in total, a dice, 4 pads to draw, 4 pencils and the 
                 rules. If the person guesses right then they get to roll the dice that detrmines the next category. They can 
                 move forward to drawing, but if there teammate does not guess correctly then the opposing team has the chance 
                 to go next. If you don't have the game then you can just draw on a paper and write your own words and phrases.
                 Then you can just make teams and have fun playing it.</p>
